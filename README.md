# OpenGL Plane Simulator

This repository contains a **plane simulator developed using OpenGL** as part of a **university project**. The simulator allows basic control of an aircraft in a 3D environment, showcasing real-time rendering, transformations, and interactive camera views.

## Features

- 3D aircraft model rendered with OpenGL
- Basic flight controls (pitch, roll, yaw, throttle)
- Simulated environment with sky and terrain
- Real-time rendering and animation
- Camera views that follow or orbit the plane
- Keyboard input for interaction
- Modular code structure for extensibility

## Technologies Used

- **OpenGL** (core rendering)
- **GLUT** / **GLFW** (for windowing and input handling)
- **C/C++** (main programming language)

## Project Context

This simulator was created as part of a university course on computer graphics. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with 3D rendering techniques and real-time interaction using OpenGL.
